        <p style="font-style: italic;">Updated in 2020: After months of traveling in Pakistan, running a tour there,
            and co-founding a sustainable tourism organization there, it’s safe to say I know a lot about travel in
            Pakistan. Here’s my complete Pakistan travel guide with information on visas, transportation, costs,
            and everything else you need to know about travel in Pakistan.</p>

        <h1>PAKISTAN BASICS</h1>

    <div class="blog3">
        <div class="d-blog1">
            <p>Pakistan is officially “The Islamic Republic of Pakistan.” A populous country in South Asia—no, it’s not
                in the Middle East—with more than 200 million people, it’s the 6th most populous country in the
                world.Lots and lots of people. Everywhere. Pakistan was founded on the 14th of August 1947 after an
                event known as Partition: when British India created the modern states of India and Pakistan. The event
                was bloody, its ramifications still visible today. The country became an Islamic Republic in 1956.During
                partition, Pakistan was divided into West and East Pakistan.In 1971 East Pakistan became Bangladesh
                after another bloody war for independence. <br> Although Pakistan is a young country, its history is
                ancient. Ruins of one of the oldest civilizations in the world, the Indus Valley Civilization, lie in
                southern Pakistan. Multiple conquerors and civilizations took hold in parts of modern-day Pakistan,
                including Alexander the Great, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, and the British Raj. <br>
                Pakistan’s recent history is marred with conflict, both internal and external, most notably with India.
                It’s struggled with military coups, terrorist attacks, war, and secessionist tensions. Its army has
                strengthened throughout the years as a result; it’s now a nuclear power and has the sixth-largest standing armed
                forces in the world.</p>

                Gulzar Mahal is a palace in the city of Bahawalpur, Pakistan, <br>
                that was built between 1906 and 1909. It was commissioned during <br>
                the reign of Sadeq Mohammad Khan V, and was built to be the<br>
                residence for womenmembers of the royal household of the former <br>

        <h1 class="heading">Regions Of Pakistan</h1>
        <p style="text-align: centre;">The country of Pakistan is divided into four provinces and three territories,
            each with its own distinct culture and flavor:</p>

                <p>Major cities/destinations: Peshawar, Chitral, Kalash Valleys
                    Far to the west of the country, and now including what was once known as the Federally Administered
                    Tribal Areas (FATA),
                    this province borders Afghanistan. Home primarily to the Pakhtun (Pashtun) people, many parts of
                    this province are evocative
                    of traveling Afghanistan. Some parts are off-limits—especially the south and regions along the
                    Afghan border—but natural</p>

                <p>Major cities/destinations: Karachi, Hyderabad, Sehwan Sharif
                    The southernmost province of Pakistan is home to its biggest city, Karachi. But venture out into
                    the rural areas,
                    known as “interior Sindh”,and you’ll find a mystic realm of moody deserts, Sufi shrines, and
                    abandoned forts.

                    Pakistan’s wealthiest province sits in the middle of the country. Though vast fields of wheat and
                    other crops make stereotypical
                    Punjabi landscapes, there are also plenty of massive Mughal relics and nature tinged with green to
                    keep travelers busy. It’s also

                    Bordering Iran and Afghanistan, the country’s largest province is also one of the least traveled.
                    Home to deserts, dusty mountains, and azure coastlines, this province is unfortunately off-limits to

                <p>Islamabad – the capital of Pakistan – is located in the Pothohar Plateau in the north of the country,
                    within the Islamabad Capital Territory.

                    The city has a population of 2 million. Together with its neighbouring twin city of Rawalpindi, the
                    greater Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area is the third largest in Pakistan with a population of
                    over 4.5 million people.

                    Islamabad – the capital city of Pakistan, is one of the most beautiful cities in the South Asian
                    region. Wide, tree-lined streets adorn the various sectors and zones of the city, making it
                    accessible and spectacular. A meticulously planned city by renowned town planners Doxiadis
                    Associates, Islamabad is the fastest growing city in terms of population, economy and urban
                    development.</p>
